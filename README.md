FoodThinger
===========

source code and database to manage food storage

FoodThinger is a free software program for creating and maintaining a food storage plan.  
Having an emergency supply of food provides peace of mind during times of unemployment or disaster.  
Using FoodThinger, you can create food storage goals based on your family's needs then track your progress towards your goals.

This version does not run on 64 bit machines because the dll that allows it to talk to sqlite is 32 bit only.

However, it shouldn't be too hard to update the database, but I haven't got to it yet.
